# IBM Data Science Capstone Project

As part of a capstone project, I took on the role of a Data Scientist with a new rocket company, Space Y that would like to compete with SpaceX. My job was to determine if SpaceX will reuse the first stage depending on the price of each launch. To achieve this goal, I was to assist with collection, web scraping, wrangling, exploratory data analysis and visualization of several datasets obtained from public source & Wikipedia pages to visualize launch sites with most success & payload ranges. Successful landing outcomes were predicted by building ML models.

The notebook files were completed as as part of the final assignment. All the data are hosted online [Click here](https://abiyselassie22.github.io/)

### Week1. Data Collection
The data were collected from public source of SpaceX API & by Webscraping SpaceX Wikipedia page. Both data were then wrangled to impute missing values, and the cleaned data was normalized.

### Week 2. Exploratory Data Analysis
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Data Visualization and SQL was performed on the wrangled data. Scatterplots, line plots & bar chart were plotted to detect any relationship between factors & identify factors for successful landing & yearly trend. 

### Week 3.  Data Visualization
Interactive Visual Analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash was then performed. An Interactive Map with Folium was built to visualize a launch site proximity to geographical markers. A Dashboard with Plotly Dash (Pie chart, Scatterplot, Payload range slider interaction) was built to visualize launch sites with most success & payload ranges.

### Week 4. Predictive Analysis
Predictive Analysis using Classification Models was performed. Successful landing outcomes were predicted by building ML models (LR, SVM, Decision Tree, KNN), tuning Hyperparameters & evaluating based on accuracy score and confusion matrix.

### Week 5. Presentation of Insights
Storytelling skills were used to provide a narrative & present data-driven insights of the predictive analysis.
